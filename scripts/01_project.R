# Project

# Are you free to give any time to the GUI stuff before we break up for
# Christmas. I am conscious that we have stalled on it and I need to kick it
# back into gear in relation to the timeline. I was also thinking it might be as
# straightforward to look at comparisons based on parental dyads scores on
# stress measures in relation to child weight outcomes- which could be done on
# something like SPSS (and which I could churn out very quickly- but I know its
# not how you usually do things).
